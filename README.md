Original Project Brief:
Rules
The project must be built using only:

HTML / CSS
Ruby
Sinatra
PostgreSQL and the PG gem
It must NOT use:

Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
JavaScript. 
Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

MVP
The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete members
The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete classes
The app should allow the gym to add members to specific classes
The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class

Possible Extensions
Classes could have a maximum capacity, and users can only be added while there is space remaining.
An instructor could only be booked if not already scheduled for a class already booked to teach in at that time.
