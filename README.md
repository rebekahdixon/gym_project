Original Project Brief:
Rules
The project must be built using only:

HTML / CSS
Ruby
Sinatra
PostgreSQL and the PG gem
It must NOT use:

Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.
Shop Inventory
Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.
